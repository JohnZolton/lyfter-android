1. the first workout cycle should not have a pre-workout survey
2. the first workout cycle should not have pre-populated weights and reps


3. populate weight based on the last cycles weight, + 2.5 lbs.
4. create a rep target that is either last cycles reps + 1 or if weight==last cycles weight, then last weeks reps
5. the exercise muscle groups need to be a select from drop down menu, they are impossible to see/access after the first 4 items
6. move the add/remove set buttons to a hamburger menu on the top-right of the exercise card, also add a move up/down on the exercise
7. make the exercise completion based on all the weights and exercises having a value (0 counts, as well as negative numbers)
8. remove the post-exercise survey button, it should pop up automatically when the exercise is completed (all entries have values)
9. add an exit workout button on the bottom or at least a workout complete text/thing
10. the modify workout plan screen doesn't show the current workout plan
11. post-exercise survey should only affect the next relative workout in the cycle
