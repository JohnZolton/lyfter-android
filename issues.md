1. the first workout cycle should not have a pre-workout survey
2. the first workout cycle should not have pre-populated weights and reps
5. the exercise muscle groups need to be a select from drop down menu, they are impossible to see/access after the first 4 items
6. move the add/remove set buttons to a hamburger menu on the top-right of the exercise card, also add a move up/down on the exercise
7. make the exercise completion based on all the weights and exercises having a value (0 counts, as well as negative numbers)
8. remove the post-exercise survey button, it should pop up automatically when the exercise is completed (all entries have values)

3. populate weight based on the last cycles weight, + 2.5 lbs.
4. create a rep target that is either last cycles reps + 1 or if weight==last cycles weight, then last weeks reps
9. add an exit workout button on the bottom or at least a workout complete text/thing
10. the modify workout plan screen doesn't show the current workout plan
11. post-exercise survey should only affect the next relative workout in the cycle
12. add a hamburger menu to the top nav of the workout page to add exercises (we'll likely need a menu/window for this)


13. the post exercise survey needs to be scrollable. in one instance the 'complete survey' button it was nearly unclickable
14. the second workout (in the same cycle, so the first cycle of a new workout plan), has exercise targets. it should not, there should be no targets because there is no prior related workout to base targets off of
15. the targets are not working properly. also the number of generated (planned) sets for a second workout (as in, it has a priorWorkout to base targest on), the targets are completely wrong (showing 0x10) when the prior workout was different
16. make the prior workouts on the home screen clickable and show you the completed workouts (just take them to the workout screen tbh)
17. the dropdown menu selectors are too laggy, please optimize somehow
